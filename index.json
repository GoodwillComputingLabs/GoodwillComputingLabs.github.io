Millions of acoustic signals received on the POAWRS system per day can make it challenging to identify individual sound sources. An automated classification system is necessary to enable sound sources to be recognized. Here, the objectives are to (i) gather a large training and test data set of fin whale vocalization and other acoustic signal detections; (ii) build multiple fin whale vocalization classifiers, including a logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) network; (iii) evaluate and compare performance of these classifiers using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score; and (iv) integrate one of the classifiers into the existing POAWRS array and signal processing software. The findings presented here will (1) provide an automatic classifier for near real-time fin whale vocalization detection and recognition, useful in marine mammal monitoring applications; and (2) lay the foundation for building an automatic classifier applied for near real-time detection and recognition of a wide variety of biological, geophysical, and man-made sound sources typically detected by the POAWRS system in the ocean","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Performances of Five Distinct Automatic Classifiers for Fin Whale Vocalizations in Beamformed Spectrograms of Coherent Hydrophone Array","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tirthak Patel","Rohan Garg","Devesh Tiwari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"80a2076b8cbfe74d8ce6b060e87308f1","permalink":"goodwillcomputinglabs.github.io/publication/dblp-conffast-patel-0-t-20/","publishdate":"2020-07-24T21:05:21.256023Z","relpermalink":"goodwillcomputinglabs.github.io/publication/dblp-conffast-patel-0-t-20/","section":"publication","summary":"Large-scale parallel applications are highly data-intensive and perform terabytes of I/O routinely.

Our network model, called preferential interdependent networks, is a novel continuum over scale-free networks parameterized by their correlation ρ,0≤ρ≤1. Our failure and recovery model ties the propensity of a node, both to fail and to assist in recovery, to its importance. We show, analytically, that our network model can achieve any γ,2≤γ≤3 for the exponent of the power law of the degree distribution; this is superior to existing multiplex models and allows us better fidelity in representing real-world networks. Our failure and recovery model is also a departure from the much studied cascading error model based on the giant component; it allows for surviving important nodes to send assistance to the damaged nodes to enable their recovery. This better reflects the reality of recovery in man-made networks such as social networks and infrastructure networks. Our main finding, based on simulations, is that resilient preferential interdependent networks are those in which the layers are neither completely correlated (ρ=1) nor completely uncorrelated (ρ=0) but instead semi-correlated (ρ≈0.1−0.3). This finding is consistent with the real-world experience where complex man-made networks typically bounce back quickly from stress. In an attempt to explain our intriguing empirical discovery, we present an argument for why semi-correlated multiplex networks can be the most resilient. Our argument can be seen as an explanation of plausibility or as an incomplete mathematical proof subject to certain technical conjectures that we make explicit.","tags":null,"title":"Resilience and coevolution of preferential interdependent networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tirthak Patel","Suren Byna","Glenn K.
